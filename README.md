### About The Project

the common responsible goal to track/reduce carbon emissions. 
It throws light on the carbon impact of their travels with the aim to raise awareness of this important topic and help them navigate towards a more environmentally responsible life.</p>

#### User Flow

<p>As a traveller, I want to analyse my already planned travel trips by flight and/or car, so that I can get an idea about the carbon emission caused by the trip.
To keep all my analysed data in one place , Iâ€™m able to save and display them on a page.</p>
